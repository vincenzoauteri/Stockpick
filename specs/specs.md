Comprehensive Design Document: Stock Recommendation Application

This document outlines the comprehensive design for a stock recommendation web application, leveraging a Go backend, React frontend, and PostgreSQL database. It details the architecture, data integration, database schema, undervaluation logic, and critical non-functional requirements, serving as a direct blueprint for an LLM coding agent.

1. Introduction


1.1. Purpose and Scope of the Stock Recommendation Application

The primary purpose of this application is to provide users with stock recommendations, specifically identifying potentially undervalued stocks. It will serve as a tool for investors to gain insights beyond basic price movements, incorporating fundamental, analyst, and sentiment data. The initial scope focuses on core functionalities: displaying historical stock prices and a robust undervaluation determination feature.

1.2. Target Audience and Key Value Proposition

The target audience includes individual investors, financial enthusiasts, and analysts seeking data-driven insights into stock valuation. The key value proposition lies in aggregating diverse financial data (price history, fundamental statements, analyst targets, social sentiment) from a single source (Financial Modeling Prep API), storing it locally for performance, and applying a multi-factor model to identify undervalued opportunities.

1.3. Technology Stack Overview (Go, React, PostgreSQL)

The application's technology stack is carefully selected to ensure high performance, scalability, and maintainability.
Go (Golang) for Backend: Go is chosen for its efficiency, strong concurrency mechanisms, and ease of use, making it an ideal candidate for handling complex business logic, external API interactions, and intensive data processing tasks.1 Its compiled nature contributes to fast execution speeds.
React for Frontend: React, a JavaScript library, is renowned for its ability to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces. It is particularly suitable for single-page applications that require frequent data updates and a responsive user experience.1 The component-based architecture of React promotes reusability and simplifies UI development.4
PostgreSQL for Database: PostgreSQL stands as a powerful, open-source relational database. Its robustness, reliability, and extensibility make it a strong choice for storing diverse financial data. The integration of TimescaleDB, a PostgreSQL extension, further optimizes it for managing large volumes of time-series data, which is crucial for financial records.5
The selection of Go, React, and PostgreSQL is not merely about leveraging their individual strengths but recognizing their synergistic combination for building data-intensive financial applications that require responsiveness and high throughput. Go's inherent concurrency capabilities effectively handle numerous concurrent requests and complex calculations, which are common in financial data processing. This complements React's efficient UI update mechanisms, ensuring that the user interface remains fluid and responsive even with dynamic data. PostgreSQL, augmented by TimescaleDB, provides a robust and performant data store capable of handling the unique challenges of time-series financial data. This cohesive technology ecosystem is well-suited to deliver smooth performance as user demand grows and application complexity increases, establishing a solid foundation for a stock recommendation platform that demands both speed and reliability.4

2. System Architecture


2.1. Overall Three-Tier Architecture

The application will adhere to a standard three-tier architecture. This architectural pattern promotes separation of concerns, enhances scalability, and improves overall security by isolating components.3
Presentation Layer (Frontend): This layer, developed with React, is responsible for rendering the user interface and managing all user interactions. It consumes data and services provided by the Application Layer through defined API calls.3
Application Layer (Backend): Built with Go, this layer encapsulates all core business logic, data processing, integrations with external APIs (specifically Financial Modeling Prep), and communication with the Data Layer. It acts as the intermediary between the frontend and the database.1
Data Layer (Database): This layer is comprised of PostgreSQL, which serves as the persistent data store for the application. It is responsible for storing all raw and processed financial information, ensuring data integrity and providing efficient data retrieval mechanisms for the backend.3

2.2. Backend Architecture (Go)

The Go backend will expose a RESTful API to the frontend, serving as the central hub for data and business logic.
RESTful API Design: The API will strictly adhere to REST principles, promoting clear, stateless communication between the frontend and backend. Endpoints will be meticulously defined for specific operations such as fetching historical stock prices, retrieving pre-calculated undervaluation recommendations, and managing data synchronization tasks.1
Concurrency Model: Go's powerful built-in concurrency features, specifically goroutines and channels, will be extensively leveraged. This approach ensures efficient handling of multiple concurrent requests, which is particularly vital when performing parallel data fetching from the Financial Modeling Prep API and executing complex undervaluation calculations.1
Microservices vs. Modular Monolith Considerations: For the initial development phase, a modular monolith approach is recommended. This structure organizes distinct logical modules (e.g., data ingestion, valuation logic, API serving) within a single Go application, simplifying initial development, deployment, and management. This strategy allows for a streamlined start, reducing overhead associated with distributed systems. However, the design will explicitly anticipate future evolution. If specific components, such as the undervaluation calculation service, become computationally intensive bottlenecks or require independent scaling characteristics, they can be extracted into separate microservices. This forward-thinking design ensures that the application can gracefully scale and adapt to increasing demands without requiring a complete architectural overhaul.4

2.3. Frontend Architecture (React)

The React frontend will be engineered to deliver a performant and intuitive user experience.
Component-Based Architecture: The user interface will be meticulously broken down into small, reusable, and modular components. Examples include StockSearch for ticker lookups, PriceChart for historical data visualization, UndervaluedList for displaying recommendations, and StockDetails for comprehensive stock information.2 This modularity enhances code maintainability and reusability.
State Management: To optimize React application performance, efficient state management is paramount. Libraries such as React Query (or TanStack Query) are highly recommended. These libraries excel at managing data fetching, providing robust caching mechanisms, and ensuring data synchronization with the backend. This approach significantly reduces redundant API calls and improves overall application responsiveness.4 The
useEffect hook will be utilized for performing data fetching operations within functional components, ensuring side effects are handled declaratively after component rendering.9
Data Fetching Patterns: To handle potentially large datasets and maintain smooth user interactions, several data fetching optimizations will be implemented:
Pagination: For displaying extensive lists of stocks or historical data, pagination will be used to retrieve data in smaller, more manageable chunks, reducing initial load times and improving performance.9
Memoization: React's memoization tools, including React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback, will be employed to prevent unnecessary component re-renders and recalculations when props or dependencies remain unchanged. This minimizes redundant render cycles and enhances UI snappiness.9
Debouncing/Throttling: For interactive elements like search inputs, debouncing and throttling mechanisms will be implemented to limit the frequency of API calls, preventing excessive requests and optimizing server load.9
Build Tooling: Vite is selected as the build tool for the React project. Its "no-bundle" development server and Rollup-based production build offer significantly faster build times and a quicker development setup compared to traditional tools like Create React App.2

2.4. Database Architecture (PostgreSQL)

PostgreSQL will serve as the robust and reliable persistent data store for the application. Its primary responsibilities include:
Local Data Storage: All raw data fetched from the Financial Modeling Prep API will be stored locally within the PostgreSQL database. This local storage minimizes reliance on external API calls for frequently accessed data, improving response times and reducing external dependencies.
Pre-calculated Metrics and Undervaluation Scores: The database will store pre-calculated financial metrics and the composite undervaluation scores derived from the analytical models. This pre-computation offloads heavy processing from real-time requests, ensuring rapid delivery of recommendations.
Efficient Data Retrieval: PostgreSQL, especially with TimescaleDB, is configured to provide highly efficient data retrieval for the Go backend, supporting complex queries required for charting historical data and performing analytical computations.
TimescaleDB Extension: The TimescaleDB extension will be installed and configured within PostgreSQL. This extension is specifically designed for optimal management and querying of time-series data, making it an ideal choice for handling the large volumes of chronological financial records.6

2.5. Communication Patterns

HTTP/JSON (RESTful APIs): The primary communication method between the React frontend and the Go backend will be through RESTful API calls. Data will be exchanged efficiently in JSON format, facilitating seamless interaction between the two layers.1
WebSockets (Potential Future Enhancement): While HTTP/JSON will handle initial data fetching, WebSockets present a valuable opportunity for future enhancements. For scenarios requiring real-time updates, such as live stock price movements or immediate shifts in sentiment scores, WebSockets could be integrated. This would allow the Go backend to proactively push data to the React frontend, significantly enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of the user experience beyond basic historical displays.2 This capability would be particularly beneficial for dynamic undervaluation status updates or live market sentiment indicators.
A notable characteristic of the Go ecosystem is its ability to embed all frontend assets directly within the Go server binary.11 This simplifies deployment considerably, as the entire application can be distributed as a single, self-contained executable, eliminating the need for separate runtime environments or complex asset serving configurations. While this approach offers unparalleled ease of deployment for smaller to medium-scale applications, it introduces a potential trade-off for larger, globally distributed systems. For such scenarios, serving static assets via a Content Delivery Network (CDN) might be a more performant and scalable strategy, as it reduces latency for users worldwide and offloads traffic from the backend server. A CDN also allows for independent frontend updates, decoupling the deployment cycles of the frontend and backend. This design acknowledges the immediate benefit of a single binary but highlights the need to consider a separate static asset serving strategy if global responsiveness and independent scaling become paramount in the future.

3. Data Sources and API Integration (Financial Modeling Prep)

The application will primarily source its financial data from the Financial Modeling Prep (FMP) API, storing it locally in the PostgreSQL database. This strategy ensures data availability, reduces external API call latency for frequently accessed data, and allows for complex local computations without hitting rate limits.

3.1. Overview of FMP API Endpoints Utilized

The following FMP API endpoints are critical for gathering the necessary data for stock price history, fundamental analysis, analyst consensus, and sentiment analysis:
Historical Stock Prices (OHLCV): The FMP Comprehensive Stock Price and Volume Data API (/historical-price-eod-full) provides end-of-day (EOD) prices, including open, high, low, close, trading volume, price changes, percentage changes, and Volume-Weighted Average Price (VWAP).12 This API offers extensive historical data, with coverage depending on the FMP plan.12 More granular data (e.g., 1-minute, 1-hour, 5-minute, 15-minute intervals) is also available through related APIs, providing detailed insights into short-term price movements.12
Fundamental Financial Statements: The FMP Financial Statement APIs provide detailed income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements. These are available in various formats, including real-time, historical (quarterly and annual), and trailing twelve months (TTM).14 The API offers over 10 years of historical financial data, crucial for in-depth fundamental analysis.14 Data is delivered in structured JSON format for easy integration.14
Analyst Estimates & Price Targets: The FMP Analyst Estimates & Price Target APIs provide access to analyst forecasts, ratings, and consensus price targets. This includes high, low, median, and consensus price targets, along with aggregated buy/hold/sell ratings.15 This data is continuously updated as new information is released, ensuring the application has the latest market expectations.16
Social Sentiment Data: The FMP Social Sentiment API (/historical/social-sentiment) allows tracking public opinion about individual stocks across social media platforms like Reddit, Yahoo, StockTwits, and Twitter.17 It provides an "absolute index" (how much people are talking about the stock), a "relative index" (discussion volume relative to the previous day), a "sentiment field" (overall percentage of positive activity), and "general perception" (more positive or negative than usual).17 This endpoint is updated hourly, providing timely insights into market mood.17

3.2. API Key Management and Rate Limit Considerations

Access to the FMP API requires an API key, which must be securely managed. Sensitive data like API keys should be stored using environment variables or a secrets manager, rather than hardcoded into the application.4
A critical aspect of integrating with the FMP API is understanding and adhering to its rate limits and bandwidth restrictions. The free plan, for instance, is limited to 250 API calls per day and 500MB of bandwidth over a trailing 30-day period.18 Paid plans offer significantly higher limits (e.g., Starter: 300 calls/minute, 20GB; Premium: 750 calls/minute, 50GB; Ultimate: 3,000 calls/minute, 150GB).18 For comprehensive historical data, especially for granular intervals like 15-minute charts, multiple API calls may be required to retrieve data spanning several years, as individual calls might be limited to a few months' worth of data.19 This constraint means that the data fetching strategy must incorporate robust rate limiting and exponential backoff mechanisms to prevent exceeding allocated limits and to gracefully handle temporary API unavailability, ensuring continuous data synchronization without service interruption. The choice of FMP plan directly dictates the depth and granularity of historical data that can be realistically stored and updated locally.

3.3. Data Fetching Strategy and Local Storage Synchronization

The application will implement a proactive data fetching strategy to populate and maintain the local PostgreSQL database. This involves scheduled background jobs in Go responsible for synchronizing data from the FMP API.
The availability of granular historical data (e.g., 1-minute, 1-hour intervals) for stock prices 12 and the hourly updates for social sentiment data 17 necessitate a robust data ingestion pipeline. Relying solely on on-demand fetching for such data would lead to performance bottlenecks and inconsistent user experiences. Therefore, the Go backend will feature a dedicated data synchronization module that:
Initial Bulk Load: Performs an initial bulk download of historical data for all relevant stocks, respecting API rate limits and handling pagination for large datasets.10
Scheduled Incremental Updates: Runs periodically (e.g., daily for EOD prices, hourly for sentiment) to fetch new and updated data, ensuring the local database remains current.
Error Handling and Retries: Implements sophisticated error handling, including retry mechanisms with exponential backoff, to manage transient network issues or API rate limit responses.20
Data Transformation: Processes raw JSON responses from FMP into the structured format required by the PostgreSQL schema before storage.
The FMP Social Sentiment API provides a nuanced view of public opinion through its "absolute index" (indicating discussion volume), "relative index" (showing change in discussion volume), and "sentiment field" (overall positive activity percentage), along with "general perception".17 This multi-dimensional data allows for a more sophisticated sentiment analysis component within the undervaluation model. Instead of a simple positive/negative score, the model can incorporate the magnitude of discussion and the trend of sentiment over time, providing a richer context for market mood.

4. Database Design (PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB)

The database schema is designed to efficiently store and retrieve diverse financial data, optimizing for time-series analysis and complex queries required for undervaluation calculations. PostgreSQL, extended with TimescaleDB, provides the necessary capabilities for this data-intensive application.

4.1. Schema Overview and Relationships

The database will utilize a star-like schema approach, where a central stocks table acts as a dimension, linking to various fact tables containing time-series and historical financial data. This structure simplifies queries and enhances readability, minimizing the need for complex joins for common analytical tasks.22 PostgreSQL schemas will be used to logically group related objects, improving organization and allowing for distinct namespaces if the application grows to include different modules.23

4.2. Detailed Table Schemas

Appropriate primary keys, foreign key relationships, consistent naming conventions, and optimized data types (e.g., NUMERIC for financial values to ensure precision, TIMESTAMPTZ for timestamps to handle time zones) will be used across all tables.25

stocks Table Schema

This table will store static reference information for each stock.

SQL


CREATE TABLE stocks (
    stock_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), -- Unique identifier for the stock
    symbol TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,                          -- Stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL)
    company_name TEXT NOT NULL,                           -- Full company name
    exchange TEXT,                                        -- Exchange where the stock is traded (e.g., NASDAQ)
    sector TEXT,                                          -- Industry sector (e.g., Technology)
    industry TEXT,                                        -- Specific industry (e.g., Consumer Electronics)
    currency TEXT,                                        -- Trading currency (e.g., USD)
    is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,                       -- Indicates if the stock is actively trading
    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),                 -- Timestamp of record creation
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()                  -- Timestamp of last record update
);



historical_prices Table Schema (Hypertable)

This table will store the OHLCV data and other price-related metrics. It will be configured as a TimescaleDB hypertable for optimal time-series performance. The combination of PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB is a strategic decision to optimize for both high write rates (for ingesting FMP data) and rapid querying over time ranges (for displaying price history and calculating undervaluation metrics). This approach ensures that the core historical_prices table efficiently handles large volumes of chronological data.6

SQL


CREATE TABLE historical_prices (
    time TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,                            -- Timestamp of the price data (TimescaleDB time dimension)
    stock_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES stocks(stock_id),   -- Foreign key to stocks table (TimescaleDB space dimension)
    open_price DOUBLE PRECISION,                          -- Opening price
    high_price DOUBLE PRECISION,                          -- Highest price
    low_price DOUBLE PRECISION,                           -- Lowest price
    close_price DOUBLE PRECISION,                         -- Closing price
    volume BIGINT,                                        -- Trading volume
    vwap DOUBLE PRECISION,                                -- Volume-Weighted Average Price
    price_change DOUBLE PRECISION,                        -- Absolute price change
    pct_change DOUBLE PRECISION,                          -- Percentage price change
    PRIMARY KEY (time, stock_id)
);

-- Convert to TimescaleDB hypertable, partitioned by time and symbol for performance
SELECT create_hypertable('historical_prices', 'time', 'stock_id', number_partitions => 4);



financial_statements Table Schema

This table will store annual and quarterly fundamental financial data. Given that financial statements and analyst targets can change over time (e.g., restatements, revisions), the schema implicitly supports Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD Type 2) by including date and created_at/updated_at fields. This ensures that historical states of these non-time-series attributes are preserved, which is crucial for accurate historical undervaluation calculations and backtesting models.22

SQL


CREATE TABLE financial_statements (
    statement_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), -- Unique identifier for the statement record
    stock_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES stocks(stock_id),      -- Foreign key to stocks table
    date DATE NOT NULL,                                      -- Date of the financial statement (e.g., end of quarter/year)
    period TEXT NOT NULL,                                    -- 'annual' or 'quarterly'

    UNIQUE (stock_id, date)                                  -- Ensure unique consensus per stock per date
);



sentiment_scores Table Schema

This table will store social media sentiment scores for stocks.

SQL


CREATE TABLE sentiment_scores (
    sentiment_id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(), -- Unique identifier for the sentiment record
    stock_id UUID NOT NULL REFERENCES stocks(stock_id),      -- Foreign key to stocks table
    timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,                          -- Timestamp of the sentiment data

    created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),                    -- Timestamp of record creation
    updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),                    -- Timestamp of last record update
    UNIQUE (stock_id, timestamp, source)                     -- Ensure unique sentiment per stock per timestamp per source
);



4.3. Indexing Strategy for Performance

A robust indexing strategy is crucial for optimizing query performance, especially in a data-intensive application. Indexes will be created on frequently queried columns and those used in WHERE, JOIN, GROUP BY, and ORDER BY clauses.29 For time-series data in
historical_prices, TimescaleDB's inherent time-based partitioning (hypertables) handles indexing efficiently.6 Multi-column indexes will be considered for queries involving multiple filter criteria.29 Regular monitoring of query performance (e.g., using
EXPLAIN ANALYZE) and index health will be performed to identify and address slow queries and bloated or unused indexes.29

4.4. Data Retention and Compression Policies

TimescaleDB offers advanced features for managing large volumes of time-series data, including data retention policies and compression.6 For
historical_prices and sentiment_scores, retention policies can be configured to automatically delete or compress older, less granular data (e.g., retaining minute-level data for 3 months, daily data for 5 years). This helps manage storage costs and ensures that queries on recent, highly granular data remain fast.6

4.5. Materialized Views for Aggregations

To further enhance query performance for the frontend, materialized views will be implemented for frequently accessed aggregated data. For example, daily or weekly summaries of OHLCV data, pre-calculated P/E ratios over specific periods, or average sentiment scores over time can be pre-computed and stored in materialized views.22 This approach shifts computational load from real-time queries to scheduled background updates, significantly reducing query response times for the frontend and improving the overall user experience. Materialized views will be refreshed periodically (e.g., daily or hourly) to ensure data freshness.22

5. Undervalued Stock Determination Logic

The core value proposition of this application is its ability to determine if a stock is undervalued. This will be achieved through a multi-factor model combining fundamental analysis, analyst consensus, and sentiment analysis. The classification of a stock as "undervalued" will be a nuanced score, not a simple binary outcome, allowing for greater flexibility and accuracy.

5.1. Fundamental Analysis Model

Fundamental analysis involves evaluating a company's financial health, growth potential, and market position to determine its intrinsic value.30 The model will leverage several key financial metrics:
Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio: Compares a company's stock price to its earnings per share (EPS). A lower P/E ratio compared to industry peers can indicate undervaluation, though the context of earnings growth and industry trends is crucial.30
Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio: Measures a company's stock price relative to its book value (assets minus liabilities). A ratio below 1 may suggest the stock is trading below its net asset value, indicating potential undervaluation, especially for asset-heavy industries.30
Debt-to-Equity (D/E) Ratio: Assesses a company's financial leverage. Lower D/E ratios generally indicate safer investments, and a strong cash flow to service debt is important.30
Free Cash Flow (FCF): Represents the cash a company has left after covering operating expenses and capital investments. Consistent positive FCF growth is a strong indicator of financial health and potential undervaluation if not reflected in the stock price.30
Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth: Consistent and positive EPS growth signals a company's increasing profitability and financial strength. A stock might appear cheap based on valuation ratios, but if earnings are shrinking, the business might not recover. Therefore, stable or accelerating EPS growth is a key factor.32
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC): Measures how effectively a company uses its capital to generate profits. A high ROIC (e.g., over 20%) compared to industry peers suggests a company can sustain long-term growth and efficiently monetize past investments.32
Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA) & EV/Revenue Ratio: These metrics are particularly useful for capital-intensive industries or growth companies with inconsistent earnings. A low EV/EBITDA or EV/Revenue ratio relative to competitors or historical levels may signal undervaluation.32
The fundamental analysis will involve comparative analysis against industry peers to contextualize these ratios.30 A simplified
Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) analysis may also be incorporated to estimate the intrinsic value based on future cash flows, providing a more absolute measure of worth.30

5.2. Analyst Consensus Integration

Analyst consensus provides insights into institutional expectations and market sentiment regarding a stock's future performance.39
Aggregation and Interpretation of Price Targets: The model will retrieve and interpret the high, low, median, and consensus (average) price targets provided by analysts.15 The
price target upside (percentage difference between current price and consensus target) will be a key metric for identifying potential growth.43
Interpretation of Analyst Ratings: Analyst ratings (e.g., "Strong Buy," "Buy," "Hold," "Sell," "Strong Sell") will be aggregated and interpreted. These ratings are often converted to a numerical scale (e.g., 1-5) for quantitative analysis.39 The distribution of ratings (e.g., number of buy vs. sell recommendations) provides a holistic view of market sentiment.42
It is important to acknowledge that analyst price targets are estimations and their historical accuracy is limited, often cited around 30% for 12-18 month horizons.43 Therefore, the model will not solely rely on a single average target. Instead, it will consider the
range of price targets (high, low, median) and the number of contributing analysts.40 A narrow range with a high number of contributing analysts might indicate a stronger, more reliable consensus, whereas a wide dispersion suggests greater uncertainty. This nuanced approach helps to gauge the strength and dispersion of the market's expectations, providing a more robust input to the undervaluation model.

5.3. Sentiment Analysis Integration

Sentiment analysis captures the emotional tone and public perception surrounding a stock, offering a behavioral finance component that complements traditional fundamental analysis.46
Interpretation of FMP Sentiment Scores: The model will interpret FMP's sentiment scores, including the "sentiment field" (overall positive activity), "absolute index" (discussion volume), "relative index" (change in discussion volume), and "general perception".17 These metrics provide a comprehensive view of public mood, from simple polarity to the intensity and trend of discussions.17
Weighting Sentiment in the Overall Undervaluation Score: While fundamental analysis focuses on a company's intrinsic value, sentiment can explain short-term market mispricings or act as an early warning system for emerging issues.35 The model will consider integrating sentiment as a dynamic factor. This could involve using sentiment as a "multiplier" or "adjuster" for the fundamental valuation, where strong positive sentiment might slightly boost a stock's perceived value, or negative sentiment might depress it, reflecting how public perception can influence price movements.50 This approach allows the application to capture market psychology that traditional financial metrics might miss.

5.4. Combined Undervaluation Scoring Model

The application will determine undervaluation through a comprehensive, weighted scoring methodology that integrates fundamental, analyst consensus, and sentiment factors.
The classification of a stock as "undervalued" will not be a simple binary outcome. Instead, it will be represented as a nuanced score or rating, potentially with associated confidence levels. This approach is necessary because fundamental metrics can vary significantly by industry, analyst targets are inherently estimations, and sentiment can be subjective and volatile.32 A weighted scoring model, which allows for configurable thresholds and industry-specific benchmarks, will provide a more robust and adaptable framework. This also helps in distinguishing genuinely undervalued stocks from "value traps"—stocks that appear cheap but have underlying fundamental weaknesses or declining business models.30
Proposed Weighted Scoring Methodology: Each factor (fundamental, analyst, sentiment) will contribute to a composite undervaluation score based on predefined weights. These weights can be configurable to allow for adjustments based on market conditions or user preferences.
Normalization: Individual metrics (e.g., P/E ratio, price target upside, sentiment score) will be normalized or scaled (e.g., using Z-scores or percentile rankings within their industry) to ensure comparability across different companies and industries.
Thresholds for "Undervalued" Classification: A stock will be classified as "undervalued" if its composite score exceeds a predefined threshold. This threshold can be static or dynamically adjusted based on market volatility or industry averages.
Considerations for Avoiding "Value Traps": The model will incorporate checks to mitigate the risk of identifying "value traps." This includes:
Prioritizing consistent earnings and free cash flow growth over simply low valuation multiples.32
Analyzing debt levels and financial stability to ensure the company is not over-leveraged.30
Considering industry trends and competitive advantages to ensure the company operates in a healthy and growing market.30

6. Core Features Implementation Details

This section outlines the implementation approach for the primary functionalities of the stock recommendation application.

6.1. Stock Price History Display

The application will provide users with comprehensive historical stock price charts.
Data Retrieval from Database: The Go backend will expose API endpoints to fetch historical OHLCV data from the historical_prices table in PostgreSQL. Queries will be optimized to retrieve data for specific time ranges and stock symbols, leveraging TimescaleDB's time and space partitioning for efficient access.6
Frontend Charting Component Requirements: The React frontend will feature a dedicated charting component responsible for visualizing the historical price data. For displaying extensive historical price data, especially if granular (e.g., 1-minute intervals), the React frontend must employ advanced rendering optimizations. Simply rendering every data point as a DOM element would lead to significant UI lag and performance bottlenecks. Therefore, techniques such as virtualization or windowing (using libraries like react-window or react-virtualized) will be essential. These libraries render only the data points currently visible within the viewport, drastically reducing the number of DOM nodes and improving scrolling performance and memory footprint.52 Additionally,
pagination will be used for navigating very long historical periods, and memoization (React.memo, useMemo, useCallback) will prevent unnecessary re-renders of chart elements when underlying data hasn't changed.9

6.2. Undervalued Stock Display

The application's central feature is the display of stocks identified as undervalued based on the multi-factor model.
Backend Logic for Undervaluation Calculation: The undervaluation calculation, involving multiple data points and complex computations across fundamental, analyst, and sentiment factors, can be computationally intensive. To ensure responsiveness and avoid real-time performance issues, the backend will implement this calculation as a scheduled background job. This job will periodically (e.g., daily after market close, or hourly for highly volatile data) pre-compute and update the undervaluation status and scores for all relevant stocks. The results will be stored in a dedicated table or as a derived field within the stocks table, or even better, in materialized views in PostgreSQL.22 This pre-computation and caching strategy significantly reduces the load on the backend during user requests, as the data is readily available.
API Endpoints for Recommendations: The Go backend will expose specific RESTful API endpoints for retrieving lists of undervalued stocks. These endpoints will allow filtering, sorting (e.g., by undervaluation score, sector), and pagination to handle large result sets efficiently.10
Frontend Display of Undervalued Stocks with Key Metrics: The React frontend will feature a dedicated component (e.g., UndervaluedList) to display the identified stocks. For each recommended stock, key metrics contributing to its undervaluation (e.g., P/E ratio, analyst price target upside, sentiment score) will be presented in an intuitive format. Users should be able to click on a stock to view its detailed profile, including historical prices and a breakdown of its undervaluation score.

7. Non-Functional Requirements

Non-functional requirements are critical for the long-term success, reliability, and user satisfaction of the application.

7.1. Performance Optimization

Achieving optimal performance is paramount for a data-intensive financial application.
Backend (Go):
Efficient Database Queries: Queries to PostgreSQL will be optimized through proper indexing, connection pooling, and the use of ORMs (if applicable) to ensure rapid data retrieval.4 TimescaleDB's hypertables and continuous aggregations will be leveraged for time-series data.6
Concurrency: Go's goroutines will be utilized to handle multiple requests concurrently and to parallelize data processing tasks, maximizing CPU utilization and throughput.1
Caching: In-memory caching or distributed caching (e.g., Redis) will be implemented for frequently accessed data (e.g., current stock prices, popular undervalued lists) to reduce database load and improve response times.4
Frontend (React):
Virtualization/Windowing: As discussed, for large lists and charts, virtualization libraries will be used to render only visible elements, significantly reducing DOM operations.52
Memoization: React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback will be widely applied to prevent unnecessary re-renders of components and recalculations of expensive values.9
Pagination & Debouncing/Throttling: These techniques will limit the amount of data fetched and the frequency of API calls, respectively, improving both client-side and server-side performance.9
Payload Size Optimization: API responses will be optimized to send only necessary data, potentially using Gzip compression on the server, to reduce network overhead.10
The application's overall performance and scalability are heavily dependent on an end-to-end optimization strategy, encompassing efficient data fetching from the PostgreSQL database and optimized data transfer and rendering in the React frontend. This holistic approach ensures that the system is not only fast at the backend and database layers (through proper indexing, TimescaleDB optimizations, and caching) but also delivers a smooth and responsive user experience on the client side by minimizing network overhead and client-side processing.9

7.2. Security

Security measures are fundamental to protect sensitive financial data and ensure application integrity.
API Security: The Go backend API will implement input validation and output sanitization to prevent common attacks like SQL injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).4 Rate limiting will be applied to API endpoints to prevent abuse and denial-of-service attacks.4
Authentication & Authorization: While not a basic feature in the immediate scope, the application's design will anticipate the future need for user accounts, watchlists, or personalized recommendations. Therefore, the backend will be designed with modular security components to allow for easy integration of robust authentication and authorization mechanisms (ee.g., OAuth 2.0, JWT, Role-Based Access Control - RBAC, Multi-Factor Authentication - MFA) without requiring a major architectural overhaul.4 This forward planning ensures that user data and personalized features can be securely introduced later.
Environment Variable Management: Sensitive data, such as API keys and database credentials, will be stored securely using environment variables or a dedicated secrets management solution (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).4 Regular credential rotation will be practiced to minimize risk exposure.

7.3. Error Handling, Logging, and Monitoring (Go Backend)

Robust error handling, comprehensive logging, and proactive monitoring are paramount for maintaining a stable and reliable financial application, especially given its data-intensive nature and reliance on external APIs.
Structured Error Handling: Go's idiomatic error handling, which treats errors as return values, will be strictly followed (if err!= nil pattern).20 The
errors package (Go 1.13+) will be used for error wrapping, allowing additional context to be added as errors propagate up the call stack, which is invaluable for debugging and understanding the root cause of issues.20 Custom error types will be defined for specific business logic failures, and centralized error handling middleware will be implemented to catch and process errors consistently, ensuring standardized error responses to the frontend and graceful recovery from panics.54
Centralized Logging: Logging provides crucial insights into application behavior, aiding in debugging, performance monitoring, and auditing.20 A structured logging library like
slog (Go 1.21+) or logrus will be used over Go's standard log package due to its limitations.56 Structured logs (e.g., JSON format) are machine-readable, making them easier to process, filter, and analyze by automated tools.56 Logs will be categorized by levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR, FATAL), and sensitive data will be excluded.56 Contextual information (e.g., request IDs, stock symbols, timestamps) will be added to logs to facilitate tracing issues across different parts of the application, especially in a concurrent environment.56 Asynchronous logging will be considered for high-throughput scenarios to prevent logging operations from blocking the main application flow.57
Monitoring Strategy: Integration with a dedicated error tracking and monitoring platform like Sentry is highly recommended.20 Sentry provides real-time error capture, detailed error reports (including stack traces and context), and customizable alerts. This proactive monitoring allows developers to detect and diagnose issues promptly, particularly those related to external API rate limits, data parsing failures, or unexpected behavior in the undervaluation logic, before they significantly impact users.20

7.4. Scalability

The architecture is designed with scalability in mind to handle increasing data volumes and user traffic.
Horizontal Scaling: The stateless nature of the RESTful Go backend allows for horizontal scaling by deploying multiple instances behind a load balancer.4 This distributes incoming traffic and improves overall throughput and availability.
Database Scaling: TimescaleDB's core feature of hypertables, which automatically partition data by time and can also partition by other columns (like stock_id), is fundamental for database scalability. This partitioning improves performance for time-series queries and allows data to be distributed across different storage locations or nodes.6 Data retention policies and compression features further contribute to efficient storage management for large datasets.6

8. Deployment and CI/CD Considerations

Efficient deployment and a robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline are essential for rapid iteration, high code quality, and reliable releases.
Simplified Deployment with Go: Go's ability to compile into a single, statically linked binary greatly simplifies the deployment process.11 This means the entire backend application, including any embedded frontend assets, can be deployed as a single executable file with no external runtime dependencies (unlike Python, Node.js, or Java environments).11 This characteristic makes containerization (e.g., using Docker) extremely straightforward and efficient, leading to smaller container images and faster startup times.
CI/CD Pipelines: Automated CI/CD pipelines will be established using tools like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or CircleCI.4 These pipelines will:
Automate Builds and Tests: Automatically build the Go backend and React frontend, run unit and integration tests on every code commit.
Containerization: Build Docker images for the Go backend.
Automated Deployments: Automate the deployment of new versions to staging and production environments, ensuring faster release cycles and reducing manual errors.4
Code Quality: Integrate static analysis tools and linters to maintain high code quality and consistency.4
This streamlined deployment process, facilitated by Go's compilation model, translates directly into faster, more reliable, and less error-prone releases, which is critical for an application that relies on timely data updates and continuous improvement.

9. Conclusions and Recommendations

The comprehensive design for the stock recommendation application, leveraging a Go backend, React frontend, and PostgreSQL with TimescaleDB, establishes a robust, scalable, and performant foundation for delivering data-driven investment insights. The architectural choices reflect a commitment to efficiency, maintainability, and future extensibility.
The application's core value proposition lies in its sophisticated undervaluation determination logic, which moves beyond simplistic metrics. By integrating fundamental analysis, analyst consensus, and social sentiment data into a weighted, nuanced scoring model, the system is designed to identify genuinely undervalued stocks while mitigating the risks of "value traps." The emphasis on comparative analysis against industry peers and the consideration of the dynamic nature of financial data (through SCD Type 2 and continuous updates) contribute to the model's accuracy and reliability.
Key recommendations for development and future iterations include:
Prioritize Data Ingestion Robustness: Given the reliance on the Financial Modeling Prep API and its rate limits, the data synchronization module in Go must be exceptionally robust, incorporating sophisticated rate limiting, backoff, and error handling mechanisms to ensure continuous and reliable data flow.
Optimize End-to-End Performance: While the chosen stack is inherently performant, continuous monitoring and optimization across all layers—from database queries (leveraging TimescaleDB's capabilities and materialized views) to frontend rendering (utilizing virtualization and memoization)—will be crucial to maintain a smooth user experience as data volumes grow.
Embrace Modularity for Future Growth: The initial modular monolith approach for the Go backend provides a manageable starting point. However, maintaining clear module boundaries will facilitate the eventual transition to a microservices architecture if specific components, particularly the computationally intensive undervaluation calculation, require independent scaling or specialized deployment.
Plan for Future Feature Expansion: The design anticipates the future integration of features like user authentication, personalized watchlists, and potentially real-time data streaming via WebSockets. Building with these future needs in mind, through modular design and API extensibility, will minimize refactoring efforts down the line.
Implement Comprehensive Observability: Robust structured logging, error tracking with tools like Sentry, and performance monitoring will be indispensable for quickly identifying, diagnosing, and resolving issues in a production environment, ensuring high availability and data integrity.
By adhering to this comprehensive design document, the development team can construct a powerful and reliable stock recommendation platform that delivers actionable insights to its users, built on a modern, high-performance technology stack.
